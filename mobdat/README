Some design notes.

Builder classes should focus on simplified, contextual interfaces. 
Info classes handle graph nodes, edges, and collections.

Graph collection represents an "is-a" relationship which is why node
decorations are inherited through collections. 

Graph edge represents, among other things, a "has-a" relationship.

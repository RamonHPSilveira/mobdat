Some design notes.

Builder classes should focus on simplified, contextual interfaces.  Info
classes handle graph nodes, edges, and collections.  The node and edge
classes should initialize themselves only. Relationships to other
objects should happen in the Info classes.

Graph collection represents an "is-a" relationship which is why node
decorations are inherited through collections. 

Graph edge represents, among other things, a "has-a" relationship.
